## Reminders 

- Thu workshop cancelled.
- Lab 1 due next **Fri 2024-10-04** at **17:00**. 


## Overview of next few weeks...

In this module we will look at three tools for drawing conclusions about the characteristics of a population from data:

-  point estimation
-  confidence intervals
-  hypothesis testing

Over next two seminars we will consider these concepts in general (to familiarize with language, notation, etc). Then we will focus on inferences in specific contexts. 

## Goals for today

Let's answer the questions:

- What are statistics?
- What are sampling distributions?
- What are point estimates?

## Experiential learning opportunity 

Candy sampling

## Candy Sampling {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
The bag contains 100 pieces of candy.

1. Divide into pairs.
2. Estimate the total weight of candy:
    - select a representative sample of 5 pieces, 
    - weigh the candy, 
    - multiply the weight by 20.
3. Record your estimate (quietly).
5. Return the sample to the bag, shake bag, pass to next pair.

**Do not weight the whole bag!**

## Statistics

A **statistic** is a quantity that can be calculated from sample data.

Prior to obtaining data, a statistic is an unknown quantity and is therefore a random variable (rv).

:::{.notes}
- Let's look at some examples. 
:::

## Examples of statistics

Viewed as *estimators* for characteristics of the population.

- sample mean, $\overline{X} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m X_i$
- sample variance, $S^2 = \frac{1}{m-1} \sum_{i=1}^m (X_i - \overline{X})^2$
- avg of extreme lengths, $\widetilde{X} = \frac{\min_{i\geq 0}(X_i) + \max_{i\geq 0}(X_i)}{2}$

:::{.callout-warning}
## Random variables have distributions

Any function of rvs $X_i$ is also a rv and, therefore, has a probability distribution.
:::

## Sampling distributions

We refer to the probability distribution for a statistic as a sampling distribution to emphasize how the distribution will vary across all possible sample data.

# What are point estimates? {.mySegue .center}


## A point estimator

Consider iid $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m \sim F(\theta)$. 

A **point estimator** $\widehat{\theta}_m$ of $\theta$ is obtained by selecting a suitable statistic $g$,
$$
  \widehat{\theta}_m = g(X_1, \dots, X_m) \,.
$$

:::{.notes}
- Consider rvs $X_i \sim F(\theta)$ (general distribution)
- Recall $\theta$ a fixed, unknown quantity
- NOTE $X_i$ ARE RVS! not observations (data points)
:::

## Closing the deal: point estimate

A **point estimate** of a parameter $\theta$ is a single number that we regard as a sensible value for $\theta$. 

A point estimate $\widehat{\theta}_m$ is computed from an estimator using sample data.

:::{.callout-warning}
## Overloaded notation

The symbol $\widehat{\theta}_m$ is typically used to denote *both* the estimator and the point estimate resulting from a given sample. 
:::  

:::{.notes}
- Likewise, we refer to statistics: used for *both* the **estimator** and the **estimate**. 
- Writing $\widehat{\theta} = 42$ does not indicate how the point estimate was obtained; therefore, it is essential to report both the estimator and the resulting point estimate. 
- In addition, we should also report a measure of precision in our estimate. 
:::


## How uncertain is our point estimate?

The standard error is one measure of the precision of an estimate. 

The **standard error** of an estimator $\widehat{\theta}$ is the standard deviation:
$$
  \sigma_{\widehat{\theta}} = \sqrt{\Var(\widehat{\theta})}\,.
$$

The **estimated standard error** is denoted by $\widehat{\sigma}_{\widehat{\theta}}$ or simply $s_{\widehat{\theta}}$.

:::{.notes}
- Often, the standard error depends on unknown parameters and must also be estimated. 
- Standard error is sometimes denoted $\mathsf{se} = \mathsf{se}(\widehat{\theta})$ and the estimated standard error by $\widehat{\mathsf{se}}$.

## Summary

Today we discussed: point estimation.

We engaged in an activity about the importance of representative sampling, sampling distributions, sampling bias, and sampling variation.
