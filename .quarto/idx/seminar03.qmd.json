On the other hand, if the sample evidence does not strongly contradict $H_0\\,,$ then we continue to believe $H_0\\,.$ \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## No \"accepting\" the null\nThe two possible conclusions of a hypothesis test are: **reject $H_0$** or **fail to reject $H_0\\,.$**\n:::\n\n:::{.notes}\n- *Fail to reject $H_0$* is sometimes phrased *retain $H_0$* or (perhaps less accurately) *accept $H_0$*\n- Why not just *accept* the null and move on with our lives? Well, if I search the Highlands for the Scottish wildcat (critically endangered) and fail to find any, does that prove they do not exist?\n:::\n\n## Know when to fold 'em\n\n- What does evidence for a hypothesis test look like?\n\n- A test statistic $T$ is a function of the sample data (like an estimator). \n\n- The decision to reject or fail to reject $H_0$ will involve computing the test statistic.\n\n\n## How extreme is the evidence?\n\n- A rejection region $R$ is the collection of values of the test statistic for which $H_0$ is to be rejected in favor of the alternative: \n$$\nR = \\left\\{ x : T(x) > c \\right\\}\\,,\n$$\nwhere $c$ is referred to as a critical value. \n\n- For observed test statistic $t$, if $t \\in R$ then we reject $H_0\\,.$ The alternative is that $t \\not\\in R$ and in this case we fail to reject $H_0\\,.$ \n\n:::{.notes}\n- A procedure for carrying out a hypothesis test is based on specifying two additional items: \n  -  test statistic \n  -  corresponding rejection region.\n- If a given sample falls in the rejection region, then we reject $H_0\\,.$\n- If $X \\in R$ then the calculated test statistic exceeds some critical value.\n:::\n\n## Recall: critical values\n\nCritical values are quantiles of the reference distribution. \nCritical values are NOT areas.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\ndf <- 10\nL <- 30\nx1 <- qchisq(1-0.05/2, df=df, lower.tail = FALSE)\nx2 <- qchisq(0.05/2, df=df, lower.tail = FALSE)\nggplot(NULL, aes(c(0,L))) + \n  geom_line(stat = \"function\", fun = dchisq, args = list(df = df), xlim = c(0, L), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_area(stat = \"function\", fun = dchisq, args = list(df = df), fill = \"blue\", xlim = c(0, x1), alpha = 0.3) + \n        geom_area(stat = \"function\", fun = dchisq, args = list(df = df), fill = \"blue\", xlim = c(x2, L), alpha = 0.3) +\n        annotate(\"text\", x = 10, y = .025, label=TeX(\"Each shaded area $=\\\\alpha$\"), color = \"blue\", size = 8) + \n        annotate(\"segment\", x = 10, xend = x1-1, y = 0.015, yend = .002, color = \"blue\", arrow=arrow(length=unit(0.2,\"cm\")), size = 2) + \n        annotate(\"segment\", x = 10, xend = x2+1, y = 0.015, yend = .002, color = \"blue\", arrow=arrow(length=unit(0.2,\"cm\")), size = 2) + \n        annotate(\"text\", x = x1, y = -0.01, label=TeX(\"$\\\\chi^2_{1-\\\\alpha, \\\\nu}$\"), linewidth = 2, size = 8) + \n        annotate(\"text\", x = x2, y = -0.01, label=TeX(\"$\\\\chi^2_{\\\\alpha, \\\\nu}$\"), linewidth = 2, size = 8) + \n        geom_segment(aes(x = x1, xend = x1, y = 0, yend = dchisq(x1, df = df)), linetype = 44) + \n        geom_segment(aes(x = x2, xend = x2, y = 0, yend = dchisq(x2, df = df)), linetype = 44) + ylim(-0.015, 0.1) + \n        theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 20))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n- Using R: `q`+distname, e.g., `qnorm`, `qt`, `qchisq`, ...\n- Using table\n:::\n::::\n\n:::{.notes}\n- $\\chi^2$ distribution is not symmetric! $\\mathsf{N}$ and $\\mathsf{t}$ are symmetric.\n- For $\\alpha/2 = 0.025\\,,$ $z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96\\,.$\n:::\n\n## Balancing act\n\nThe basis for choosing a rejection region involves balancing **Type I** and **Type II** errors.
